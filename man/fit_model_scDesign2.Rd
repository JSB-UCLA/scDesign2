\arguments{
\item{data_mat}{A matrix of shape p by n that contains count values. Each of its
column names should be the cell type names of that cell. Its column
names should also match \code{cell_type_sel}.}

\item{cell_type_sel}{A character vector that contains the selected cell types for which a
model will be fitted.}

\item{sim_method}{Specification of the type of model.
Default value is 'copula', which selects the copula model.
'ind' will select the (w/o copula) model.}

\item{marginal}{Specification of the types of marginal distribution.
Default value is 'auto_choose' which chooses between ZINB, NB, ZIP
and Poisson by a likelihood ratio test (lrt) and whether there is
underdispersion.
'zinb' will fit the ZINB model. If there is underdispersion, it
will choose between ZIP and Poisson by a lrt. Otherwise, it will try to
fit the ZINB model. If in this case, there is no zero at all or an error
occurs, it will fit an NB model instead.
'nb' fits the NB model that chooses between NB and Poisson depending
on whether there is underdispersion.
'poisson' simply fits the Poisson model.}

\item{jitter}{Logical, whether a random projection should be performed in the
distributional transform.}

\item{zp_cutoff}{The maximum propotion of zero allowed for a gene to be included
in the joint copula model.}

\item{ncores}{A numeric value that indicates the number of parallel cores for model
fitting. One core for each cell type.}
}
\value{
A list with the same length as \code{cell_type_sel} that contains the fitted model
as each of its element.
